Popular Electronics was my favorite magazine in the whole world. They
were the folks who ran the article about the machine that started it
all - the Altair 8800. I knew absolutely nothing about computers at
the time. But they were <em>cool.</em> They looked all high-tech,
with all the blinking lights and everything.  And people I idolized,
like NASA engineers, used them!</p><p>It was pretty mind-boggling that my county's school system actually
had a computer for students to use - if they took the right classes,
of course. That was a computer shared by all the high schools in the
county, mind, not a computer per school. And there I was, seeing my
favorite magazine talking about a <em>personal</em> computer. I read that article with lust in my heart. Just
imagine: a computer of your very own!</p><p>The Altair was completely out of my reach, though. I was operating on
a junior high school kid's budget, and a minimal Altair system
would've set you back about $1000. That would've bought you a system
with perhaps 4k of memory, a cassette recorder for mass storage, and a
front panel full of switches and lights to program it. Things got even
more expensive quickly if you wanted luxuries like, say, a keyboard or
a video display.</p><p>It was all totally out of the question on a teenager's budget. There
were other computers floating around shortly after that, but they were
all competition for the Altair, with similar price tags. I could only
dream.</p><h2>Building my first computer</h2><p>Then a miracle happened: Popular Electronics published a construction
article about a computer I could actually afford. The <a href="http://www.cosmacelf.com/">Cosmac Elf</a> was even more restricted than the
Altair; it only had 256 bytes (yup, 1/4k) of memory, for example. But
it was only about $100 of parts; less if you scrounged a little.</p><img src="/images/background/Cosmac_Elf.png" width="400" height="544" /><p>And so I scraped together enough money for it.</p><p>Interestingly, the most expensive single components were a pair of
single-digit hexadecimal LED displays, not the microprocessor or
memory chips. That was my introduction to one of the basic principles
of computers: the peripherals are always the most expensive part.</p><p>Because I was trying to keep things as cheap as possible, I didn't use
those hexadecimal displays. I used an alternative binary display (8
LEDs) described in the article. The hex digit displays would've set me
back about $30 for the pair; the binary display option cost about $10,
as I recall.</p><h2>Learning to program</h2><p>So, after wiring it all up and double-checking my work, the moment of
truth arrived: I turned it on, while praying as hard as I ever had
that nothing would produce smoke.</p><p>And the stupid thing just <em>sat there.</em> Turned out that it
wasn't going to do anything until I learned to program it. The
construction article had a sidebar that was an introduction to
machine-language programming, and I devoured it.</p><p>After playing with the example programs, I set out to write my very
first original program: a 'bouncing ball' display on those 8
front-panel LEDs. Light up the leftmost LED, then turn it off and
light up the next one, until I got to the rightmost one, then start
back to the left, going back and forth across the display so that it
looked like a moving light.</p><p>I got done toggling in my first try (loading programs one byte at a
time with toggle switches gets old really fast, by the way), and
flipped the run switch. All eight LEDs lit up, dimly.</p><p>Now came my introduction to debugging. After using the basic debugging
technique known as "staring at the code and thinking", I realized my
mistake. Even that little computer was so fast that my eyes couldn't
keep up; it was actually working just fine, but the ball of light was
bouncing so fast that it all blurred together. A little calculation
told me that it was going back and forth a few thousand times per
second. Fortunately, the little article sidebar had a section on something
called "delay loops". After I played around with that idea for a bit,
I got my bouncing ball to bounce properly.</p><p>And I was hooked.</p><h2>Learning to program, phase II</h2><p>After more user-friendly machines came along, I negotiated an
agreement with the owner of my local Radio Shack. I got to hang out in
the store and play with his display model TRS-80, in exchange for
making myself scarce when paying customers were around, and for
sometimes helping him make sales ("Hey, if a kid can use it, surely
you can..."). Having a keyboard and video display, and an actual
high-level language was _wonderful_, and I learned a lot from that
little beast.</p><p>When I went to college, I had to decide between the two subjects that
interested me enough to consider majoring in: physics and computer
science. I decided to major in physics, on the grounds that I had
never found anything having to do with computers that I couldn't
eventually figure out, but it was very handy to have people to ask
stupid physics questions of.</p><p>But that didn't mean giving up my computer addiction. Using the
university's computers meant signing up for classes, though; they were
very stuffy about that. So I ended up with four computer classes on my
transcript; two introductory courses that I took purely to get onto
the school's computers, and two graduate school courses ("Principles
of AI" and "Compiler Architecture") that I wheedled my way into
because they were actually interesting and taught me things I didn't
know.</p><p>College was also my introduction to Unix (specifically BSD 4.2 and
4.3), and I still prefer that environment to any other. I use Linux
these days, but it's the same world for most purposes.</p><h2>Linux!</h2><p>After finishing a bachelor's degree, I decided that a career in
academia was not for me, so I was faced with the necessity of earning
a living. By happy accident, people were willing to pay me to program
computers.</p><p>In the early 90s, I was working professionally mostly on IBM PCs
running MS-DOS, but my personal machine, my pride and joy, was an
Amiga 1000. First microcomputer to have a dedicated graphics
accelerator, and a very nice GUI, all shoehorned into 512k of
RAM. Windows (version 2 at the time), by contrast, was more a
proof-of-concept than a useful environment. Macs were nice, but the
Amiga was better.</p><p>Then another miracle happened. Some guy from Finland released his toy
Unix clone, with a warning that it was just a hobby project that
probably would never amount to anything much. I bought my first
PC-compatible to run it, and have never looked back; I retired my
Amiga as soon as someone ported the X Window System. Linux rocks
beyond words.</p><p>Since then I've worked on desktop applications, embedded systems,
mainframes (a bit), back-end web apps, and front-end web apps. It's
all fun.</p><p>These days, I'm running a decently fast machine and Gentoo Linux. I
don't recommend Gentoo unless you're crazy in much the same way that I
am (Gentoo builds everything from source code on your machine), but
it's great if you are.</p><div id="bottom-navigation"><span class="navigation-prev"></span><span class="navigation-up"><a href="/index.html">^ Up</a></span><span class="navigation-next"></span></div></div></body></html>
