it. I'm going to stay fairly pedestrian and non-clever here, and after
a quick check with Google to try and avoid duplicating names with
another project, just name it "ruby-explorer". (I really wanted to
use "t-rex", with the justification that it stands for "The Ruby
Explorer". Sadly, that name is already taken by multiple projects.)</p><p>So, naming taken care of, I've created a <a href="https://github.com/jmax315/ruby-explorer">Github repository for the project</a>.</p><p>All good software starts the same way: bite off a manageable chunk
and make it work. I find that it's best to have that chunk be a
working application, however rudimentary. Starting with a working app
helps avoid painting yourself into a corner with an unworkable
design. You'll find out fast if you're headed that way, while the cost
to correct it is lowest. In the interest of keeping things simple for
the first pass, it'll be a command-line app.</p><p>For starters, let's say that I want to know all of the files loaded by
a Rails project. This should be a fairly straightforward exercise,
with plenty of room to add extra functionality once that's up and
running.</p><p>A bit of terminology here: when I want to talk about the code we're
exploring, I'll use the adjective "target". So I might talk about the
"target application", or "target code", for example.</p><h3>Figuring Out the Clever Bit: A Spike</h3><p>There's a bit of exploration to do here before I start on the app
itself; the problem at hand is the basic question of how to intercept
calls to Ruby's core methods. The terminology I like for this sort of
exploration is taken from Extreme Programming (XP), and is "spike". A
spike is just a bit of exploratory code. It is not production code,
nor is it ever intended to be. Its sole purpose is to learn something.</p><p>To begin with the smallest piece, I'll tackle the simple problem of
noting every time that the target code calls <code>require</code>. I
won't worry about calls to <code>require_relative</code>
or <code>load</code>; if I can handle <code>require</code> in the spike, then I'm confident I can handle all
three in the production code.</p><p>For target code, we'll use a simple "hello, world" program with one <code>require</code> at the top:</p><pre><code>require 'socket' # Arbitrary module; not actually used

puts "In the subject app"
</code></pre><p>Only slightly more code is needed to spy on the target:</p><pre><code>module Kernel
  alias_method :original_require, :require

  def require(name)
    puts "doing require(#{name})"
    return_value= original_require(name)
    puts "require(#{name}) returned #{return_value}"
    return_value
  end
end
</code></pre><p>There's some subtle stuff going on here, though. First, we're opening up the <code>Kernel</code> module, one of the foundations of Ruby. The
ability to re-open and "monkey-patch" an existing module or class is
one of the things that makes sophisticated metaprogramming
possible. Next, we use <code>alias-method</code> to create a new
name for <code>require</code>. It is important to distinguish between
the code for a method and the name of the method. After
the <code>alias_method</code>, we have two names for the same
code. The same code will be invoked if we call <code>require</code>
or <code>original_require</code>.</p><p>Next, we define <code>require</code> in the usual way. This creates
a new chunk of code and names it <code>Kernel::require</code>. The
original code for <code>require</code> is still there, and we can
get to it via the name <code>original_require</code>, even though the
name <code>require</code> is now attached to our new block of code.</p><p>After managing this trick, the rest is straightforward; we tell the
user that we're about to call require, actually do the call to the
original require method, making sure to remember what it returned, and
tell the user about the return value. Then we actually return the
value.</p><p>The code for the initial spike is checked in under the directory <code>spikes/wrap-require.</code></p><p>We can use Ruby's -r option to force it to load our inspection code
before the target app, so that we can get our hooks
into <code>require</code> before the target can call it. When we try
all this out, it looks like:</p><pre><code class="shell">jmax@deepthought $ ruby -r ./wrap_require.rb subject_app.rb
doing require(socket)
doing require(socket.so)
require(socket.so) returned true
doing require(io/wait)
require(io/wait) returned true
require(socket) returned true
In the subject app
jmax@deepthought $
</code></pre><p>And we've already uncovered something interesting. The target's
call <code>require 'socket'</code> does two requires of its own,
for <code>socket.so</code> and <code>io/wait</code>. The second
require isn't particularly odd; it's just loading up another chunk of
code that it wants to use. The first one, though, is loading up
a <em>binary</em> file; a shared library, probably written in
C. This is a peek into the guts of a Ruby extension; if there's
non-Ruby code involved, it gets packaged as a shared library, and the
.so then gets loaded with <code>require</code>, just as a Ruby file
would be.</p><p>All this is almost completely transparent to the target code; the
only things affected are:</p><ul><li>There is some extra output to <code>$stdout.</code></li><li><code>require</code> will take slightly more time, because our code gets executed in addition to the original code.</li><li>There's a new name, <code>original_require</code> in the <code>Kernel</code> module.</li></ul><p>The first thing is simply an artifact of this being a spike; we're
investigating how to wrap an existing method, and haven't made any
effort to leave $stdout untouched. In production code, we'll have to
avoid polluting the target's output.</p><p>The second somewhat unavoidable. By the very nature
of metaprogramming, we're going to be executing some extra code; all
we can do is keep the overhead as low as possible.</p><p>We'll deal with the third item, not polluting the target code's name space, next.</p><p>Summarizing what we've learned from our spike, there are three points:</p><ul><li>We can wrap existing methods.</li><li>Don't touch target's output</li><li>Minimize the amount of code injected</li></ul><p>I'll record these items in the project's Github wiki on a <a href="https://github.com/jmax315/ruby-explorer/wiki/Notes">Notes</a> page, so I don't forget them. As I address them, and as I discover
new things, I'll update that page.</p><div id="bottom-navigation"><span class="navigation-prev"><a href="overview.html">&lt; Prev</a></span><span class="navigation-up"><a href="toc.html">^ Up</a></span><span class="navigation-next"><a href="better_monkey_patching.html">Next &gt;</a></span></div></div></body></html>
