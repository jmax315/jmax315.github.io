object, <code>RubyExplorer</code>, in order to have something to
attach the CLI to. Now it's time to put some flesh on that skeleton's
bones.</p><p>So, what does the application object have to do? It needs to:</p><ul><li>Insert the code to monkey-patch <code>require</code> into the target Rails app</li><li>Start the target Rails app</li><li>Display the output from our version of <code>require</code></li></ul><p>In addition, when we start the target Rails app, we need to respect
the app's (possible) use of rvm, and its (likely) use of bundler.</p><p>Another bit of terminology again: In hardware development, one uses
a probe from a test instrument (e.g., an voltmeter) to connect to the
circuit under development and look at what's going on. By analogy, I'm
going to refer to the code inserted into the target Rails app as
the <em>probe</em>.</p><p>We can insert our probe into the target application in the same way
that our spikes did, using Ruby's <code>-r</code> option. Respecting
bundler should happen automatically, as long as we don't do anything
to mess that up.  Respecting rvm is slightly trickier.</p><p>Rvm and similar packages work their magic by hooks in bash that are
installed when the user logs in. We can fake a login shell by using
bash's <code>-l</code> option, but that leaves us with a quandary: We
want to load up the application using <code>ruby -r</code>, but at
the same time we want to use <code>bash -l</code> to make sure we
let rvm insert itself. Fortunately, bash also provides an option that
gets us out of the dillema:<code>-c</code>.</p><p>When run with <code>-c</code>, bash doesn't read commands from the
user, as it normally would. Instead, it expects a single command to be
provided as a command line argument.  It starts up, runs the specified
command, and then exits. Putting all of this together (and ignoring,
for the moment, the issue of what directory our probe code is in
versus what directory the target app is in; we'll deal with that in a
bit) we can accomplish what we want if we start up the app like:</p><pre><code>bash -l -c 'ruby -r probe.rb bin/rails'</code></pre><p>So let's write our first test for <code>RubyApplication</code>:</p><pre><code>require './src/ruby_explorer'

describe "RubyExplorer#run" do
  let(:app) { RubyExplorer.new }

  before do
    allow(Process).to receive(:spawn)
    app.run
  end

  it "spawns the probe inserter" do
    expect(Process).to have_received(:spawn).with("/bin/bash",
                                                  "-l",
                                                  "-c",
                                                  "ruby -r probe bin/rails")

  end
end
</code></pre><p>And the code to make it pass is:</p><pre><code>class RubyExplorer
  attr_accessor :target_directory

  def run
    Process.spawn("/bin/bash", "-l", "-c", "ruby -r probe bin/rails")
  end
end
</code></pre><p>As I mentioned, we've entirely neglected the issue of directories
for ruby-explorer and the target app here. In addition, although we've
got a unit test in place to ensure that we're doing what we want to,
but we don't have any assurance that it all works. To get that
confidence, we have to actually run the application.</p><p>To run the application, we need a Rails app to be our
target. Eventually, we want to run this on a "legacy" app - one
that's already been written to do something. After all, that's
ultimately the point. For now, though, all we want is to ensure that
we start the target app, so we can just create a new rails app and use
that for our target app.</p><pre><code class="lang-shell">jmax@deepthought $ rvm use 2.5.5@bare-rails --create

</code></pre><p>So now we have a target app. When we try running with ruby-explorer,
it fails, of course.</p><pre><code class="lang-shell">jmax@deepthought $ bin/ruby-explorer ../bare-rails
bash: bin/ruby-explorer: Permission denied
jmax@deepthought $
</code></pre><p>Wups! Our CLI doesn't have execute permission. This is simple enough
to fix; we flip the execution permission bit on the CLI and try
again.</p><pre><code class="lang-shell">jmax@deepthought $ chmod 744 bin/ruby-explorer
jmax@deepthought $ bin/ruby-explorer ../bare-rails
jmax@deepthought $ Traceback (most recent call last):
ruby: No such file or directory -- bin/rails (LoadError)

jmax@deepthought $
</code></pre><p>And it fails in a much more reasonable fashion. We're looking
for <code>bin/rails</code> under the root directory of
ruby-explorer, and of course it isn't there; it's in the target app's
directory.</p><p>To fix this, we have to change to the target app's directory. We
already know what that directory is; our CLI stashed it in <code>RubyExplorer#target_directory</code>. Time for another test:</p><pre><code>require './src/ruby_explorer'

describe "RubyExplorer#run" do
  let(:app) { RubyExplorer.new }
  let(:target_directory) {"target_directory"}

end
</code></pre><p>And the code to make it pass is:</p><pre><code>class RubyExplorer

  def run
    Dir.chdir(target_directory)
    Process.spawn("/bin/bash", "-l", "-c", "ruby -r probe bin/rails")

end
</code></pre><p>Running it, we fail again.</p><pre><code class="lang-shell">jmax@deepthought $ bin/ruby-explorer ../bare-rails

</code></pre><p>This time, we failed because Ruby can't find our probe. We've got
several problems here. First, we haven't even created a probe. Second,
when we do, it'll be back in ruby-explorer's directory. Third, back
when we set up the test for ruby-explorer's call
to <code>spawn</code>, we forgot to include the .rb extension on the
probe.</p><p>Fixing these problems in the test, we get:</p><pre><code>require './src/ruby_explorer'

    Dir.chdir(target_directory)
    Process.spawn("/bin/bash", "-l", "-c", "ruby -r #{original_directory}/src/probe.rb bin/rails")

</code></pre><p>So close. The only reason we failed this time is that we didn't tell
rails to start a server; in fact we didn't tell it to do anything.
Fixing the test and code again:</p><pre><code>require './src/ruby_explorer'

  let(:app) { RubyExplorer.new }
  let(:target_directory) {"target_directory"}
  let(:original_directory) {"original-directory"}

empty probe. We really aren't doing anything more than running Rails
in an unusual fashion. In fact, we don't even have any feedback to
tell us our probe is getting loaded. We'll tackle putting some real
guts into the probe shortly, but first lets just print something from
inside the probe.</p><pre><code>class Probe

puts "Hello from the probe!"

jmax@deepthought $
</code></pre><p>Before we start work on the probe in the next section, let's clean
up the tests a bit. We should always keep our code, which includes the
code for tests, as clean as possible.  There's actually not much to
criticize in the RubyExplorer class, but we've got a little bit of a
smell in our tests for it:</p><pre><code>require './src/ruby_explorer'

describe "RubyExplorer#run" do
  let(:app) { RubyExplorer.new }
  let(:target_directory) {"target_directory"}
  let(:original_directory) {"original-directory"}

  before do
    allow(Dir).to receive(:chdir)
    allow(Process).to receive(:spawn)
    allow(Dir).to receive(:getwd).and_return(original_directory)

    app.target_directory= target_directory
    app.run
  end

  it "spawns the target app" do
    expect(Dir).to have_received(:chdir).with(target_directory).ordered
    expect(Process).to have_received(:spawn).with("/bin/bash",
                                                  "-l",
                                                  "-c",
                                                  "ruby -r #{original_directory}/src/probe.rb bin/rails server").ordered
  end
end
</code></pre><p>We're actually testing three different things at once.</p><ul><li>First, we test that we change to the correct (i.e. the target) directory</li><li>Second we test that we spawn the Rails app correctly</li><li>Finally, we also test that we do things in the correct order; that
is, we must change to the target directory before trying
to start up the target app.</li></ul><p>The first two are checked by having <code>.with</code> clauses on
the <code>expect</code> statements, which check the arguments
passed.  The third thing is checked by the <code>.ordered</code>
clauses, which check that the calls happen in the same order as
the <code>expect</code> statements.</p><p>It's also a little annoying that we have two separate
expectations in our test; ideally, each test should check for one and
only one thing, so that if it fails, we can easily determine what's
wrong.</p><p>At this point, things are not awful, but it's best to clean them
up <em>now</em>, before they get any worse. So, splitting our
existing test into three tests, we get:</p><pre><code>require './src/ruby_explorer'

describe "RubyExplorer#run" do
  let(:app) { RubyExplorer.new }
  let(:target_directory) {"target_directory"}
  let(:original_directory) {"original-directory"}

  before do
    allow(Dir).to receive(:chdir)
    allow(Process).to receive(:spawn)
    allow(Dir).to receive(:getwd).and_return(original_directory)

    app.target_directory= target_directory
    app.run
  end

  it "changes to the the target directory" do
    expect(Dir).to have_received(:chdir).with(target_directory)
  end

  it "spawns the target app" do
    expected_ruby_command=
      "ruby -r #{original_directory}/src/probe.rb bin/rails server"

    expect(Process).to have_received(:spawn).
                         with("/bin/bash",
                              "-l",
                              "-c",
                              expected_ruby_command)
  end

  it "changes directories before trying to spawn" do
    expect(Dir).to have_received(:chdir).ordered
    expect(Process).to have_received(:spawn).ordered
  end
end
</code></pre><p>Looking at that, we've still got one more problem with our app
class. We're assuming that the current directory is the root of the
ruby-explorer project, which won't generally be true. So lets' modify
the tests to remove that assumption. This is actually slightly
tricky.</p><p>At first glance, we might try picking the directory for the <code>ruby-explorer</code> binary off of <code>$0</code>. This
won't work, though, because at the time when we need the directory
for <code>probe.rb</code>, we won't be in our original location; we
will have changed directories to the target project.</p><p>Or, rather, it won't <em>always</em> work. It will work if
the original command to run ruby-explorer used an absolute path, for
example: <code>/home/jmax/ruby-explorer/bin/ruby-explorer</code>. This
gives our way to resolve the problem: before we change to the target
project's directory, we need to get the directory part
of <code>$0</code> and convert it to an absolute path. So the test
ends up like:</p><pre><code>require './src/ruby_explorer'

describe "RubyExplorer#run" do
  let(:app) { RubyExplorer.new }

  let(:target_directory) {"../target-directory"}
  let(:bin_directory) {"../ruby-explorer/bin"}
  let(:cli_binary_path) {"#{bin_directory}/ruby-explorer"}
  let(:absolute_bin_directory) {"/home/user/ruby-explorer/bin"}
  let(:absolute_src_directory) {"/home/user/ruby-explorer/src"}

  before do
    allow(Dir).to receive(:chdir)
    allow(Process).to receive(:spawn)
    allow(File).to receive(:expand_path).and_return(absolute_src_directory)

    $0= cli_binary_path
    app.target_directory= target_directory
    app.run
  end

  it "finds the absolute path of the src directory" do
    expect(File).to have_received(:expand_path).with("#{bin_directory}/../src")
  end

  it "changes to the the target directory" do
    expect(Dir).to have_received(:chdir).with(target_directory)
  end

  it "spawns the target app" do
    expected_ruby_command=
      "ruby -r #{absolute_src_directory}/probe.rb bin/rails server"

    expect(Process).to have_received(:spawn).
                         with("/bin/bash",
                              "-l",
                              "-c",
                              expected_ruby_command)
  end

  it "picks off the src directory, changes directories, and spawns, in that order" do
    expect(File).to have_received(:expand_path).ordered
    expect(Dir).to have_received(:chdir).ordered
    expect(Process).to have_received(:spawn).ordered
  end
end
</code></pre><p>And the code changes to:</p><pre><code>require 'pathname'

class RubyExplorer
  attr_accessor :target_directory

  def run
    bin_directory= Pathname.new($0).dirname
    src_directory= File.expand_path("#{bin_directory}/../src")
    Dir.chdir(target_directory)
    Process.spawn("/bin/bash", "-l", "-c", "ruby -r #{src_directory}/probe.rb bin/rails server")
  end
end
</code></pre><p>Trying all this out, we cd up a level and run <code>ruby-explorer</code>:</p><pre><code class="lang-shell">jmax@deepthought $ cd ..
