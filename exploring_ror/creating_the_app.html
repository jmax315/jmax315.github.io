infrastructure to set up. I am a fan of <code>rvm</code> for keeping
my projects isolated from one another, and of Bundler for explicitly
managing Gem versions. So let's get them set up:</p><pre><code class="lang-shell">jmax@deepthought $ rvm use ruby-2.6.5@ruby-explorer --ruby-version --create
ruby-2.6.5 - #gemset created /home/jmax/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.6.5@ruby-explorer
ruby-2.6.5 - #generating ruby-explorer wrappers.........
Using /home/jmax/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.6.5 with gemset ruby-explorer
jmax@deepthought ~/projects/ruby-explorer $ gem install bundler
Fetching bundler-2.1.4.gem

1 gem installed
jmax@deepthought $ bundle init
Writing new Gemfile to /home/jmax/projects/ruby-explorer/Gemfile
jmax@deepthought $
</code></pre><p>So that's done. But this immediately brings up another issue. Lots
of Rails projects are also going to be using <code>rvm</code> (or
an <code>rvm</code>-compatible Ruby management package), and
essentially <em>all</em> Rails projects are going to be using
Bundler. We need to not interfere with either of those. So that goes
on the <a href="https://github.com/jmax315/ruby-explorer/wiki/Notes">Notes</a> page.</p><p>I strongly prefer to code in a test-driven fashion, writing the
tests before the code (spikes are an exception, and that's one of the
reasons for my "spikes are not and will never be production code"
rule). My testing framework of choice is <code>RSpec</code>, so
installing that's next:</p><pre><code class="lang-shell">jmax@deepthought $ gem install rspec

</code></pre><h3>The CLI</h3><p>As an architecture for applications in general, it's best to have the
top-level CLI wrapper just handle the command line arguments and options,
create and configure an application object, then pass off control to
it.</p><p>So, the first test is simply that the CLI creates an application object.
I'm going to go through this first test in rather excruciating
detail; I'll speed up the presentation after that, I promise.</p><pre><code>describe "The CLI" do
  before do
    $the_app= nil
    load("bin/ruby-explorer")
  end

  it "creates the app" do
    expect($the_app).not_to be_nil
  end
end
</code></pre><p>We fake running the script by calling <code>load</code>. Ruby, in
fact, when run on a file, does load the file. There's also some setup
to deal with the command line, but since we're not worrying about the
command line yet, so the test doesn't bother with faking any of
it. We'll have to deal with that in a few minutes, but for now, we can
ignore the issue. Running the test, we get:</p><pre><code class="lang-shell">jmax@deepthought $ rspec

</code></pre><p>Progress! The test still fails. But the important point is that it
fails <em>differently.</em> Before, we were failing because the
CLI didn't exist. Now, we're failing because the app class doesn't exist.</p><p>The next thing to do, obviously, is create the app class, in
src/ruby_explorer.rb:</p><pre><code>class RubyExplorer
end
</code></pre><p>And our first test passes. Before leaving it, there's one more thing
to check. A secondary purpose of the tests is to provide
documentation, so before considering a test finished, let's like to run
the test suite in verbose mode, to ensure that the test description is
sensible. Running <code>rspec -fd</code>, we get:</p><pre><code class="lang-shell">jmax@deepthought $ rspec -fd

1 example, 0 failures

jmax@deepthought $
</code></pre><p>That looks pretty good, so this step is complete</p><p>There's a bunch more fiddly bits involved in testing the CLI, which
I'm going to skip over here, because they aren't directly related to
the topic at hand (snooping on a Rails app). The details of
the CLI testing are interesting enough to warrant a detailed post,
just not here. I'm adding that to my list of topics on deck. Watch
that space if you want details.</p><p>When all was said and done, the stub app class ended up like this:</p><pre><code>class RubyExplorer
  attr_accessor :target_directory

  def run
  end
end
</code></pre><p>With this for the CLI itself:</p><pre><code>#!/bin/env ruby

require 'optparse'

require_relative '../src/ruby_explorer.rb'


optparser= OptionParser.new do |opts|
  opts.banner= "usage: ruby-explorer [options] project-directory"
  opts.separator ""

  opts.on("-h", "--help", "Show this message") do
    $stderr.puts opts
    exit false
  end
end

optparser.parse!

if ARGV.length != 1
  $stderr.puts optparser
  exit false
end

$the_app= RubyExplorer.new
$the_app.target_directory= ARGV[0]
$the_app.run

exit true
</code></pre><p>The CLI checks the command line for <em>syntactic</em> validity;
i.e. does the command line contain valid options and only one target
directory. (Right now, there's only one valid option, -h (or --help),
but this will likely change.) Assuming that the command line is
syntactically valid, the CLI creates the application object, sets
its <code>target_directory</code> property, and calls
its <code>run</code> method. <em>Semantic</em> validity
checking (checking whether the target directory actually exists, is a
Rails project, and so on) is the application object's
responsibility.</p><p>The CLI shouldn't change much during subsequent
development. Changes should be just adding new options and passing
their values through to the application object.</p><p>If we do decide to eventually create a really sophisticated CLI,
then it would be best to use something like the <code>thor</code> gem, which handles most of the boilerplate for such things. The
other plausible paths that we might take are to create a GUI, or a web
front end.  Right now, there's no need to get too fancy, and whatever
we do later, having most of the logic outside of the actual CLI should
help keep things decoupled enough to make upgrading the user interface
fairly straightforward.</p><p>The test code for the CLI was actually the most complicated part:</p><pre><code>require './src/ruby_explorer'
